### Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.



1. Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige';

2. Perform basic math
area = 3 * 2;

3. Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';

4. Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
buy = 3 > 5;

5. Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

## there are seven operators like below

1. Addition     `+`     Adds one value to another
2. Subtraction      `-`     subtracts one value from another 
3. Divsion      `/`     divides two values 
4. Multiplication       `*`     Multiplies two values using an asterisk
5. Increment        `++`        adds one to the current number 
6. Decrement        `--`        subtracts one from the current number 
7. Modulus      `%`     divides two values and return the remainder

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

![function](https://miro.medium.com/max/3832/1*G9XsIxODBSxmM2Iyqgal-g.png)

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

The syntax of function is as below 
```
**Function** *sayHi*() {
    *code block*; 
} 

```
### and calling it is as easy as cutting a cake by typing 
```
itsName(); wherever you want 
```
