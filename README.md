### Markdown

Markdown is a way to style and write code on web with non-alphabetic characters like # * _ 
also some places in github allow you to write in markdown style text language

for examples 
if you want to Emphasise line or a word
you can use 
**BOLD** if you want to make BOlD
__BOLD__ if you want to make BOlD
*italic* if you want it italic
_italic_ if you want it italic
or writing a blockquotes like > we're living the future so
also you can do both in one line

and if want to do a list you can do it like below

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item belongs to Item 2 
  
  
or ordered list like below
1. Item1
4. Item2 
  1. Item belongs to Item 4
  
 
also you can share an image by typing the below 

![google logo](/its place on your files)

as well as sharing links like

[Google](http://google.com)

and if you want to highlight a syntax you can do it like 
``` print("Hello World")```
