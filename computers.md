computer science explored how to design a thinking machine that perform four different tasks.

it would need to take an **input** from real world into machine world and **store** the information in the memory and **process** it in CPU and eventually show the result as an **ouput**.

computer started out as basic calculators and then developed bit by bit and we can do a lot of things with these amazing machines.

# what is inside computer machines

inside a computer there are electric wires and circuts that carry all the information in computer by using the 0,1 machine language which is just use 0 1 to do task it is very basic language but we can do a lot of that by turning it into more advanced language by adding more complex 
line of `0 1`

also I learnd that the most important of the hardware in the computer is the CPU which do all the tasks and tells other parts to do so
and for softwre the most important thing is the OS opreating system which allow us to deal with other software apps and programs.
