## USING COMPARISON OPERATORS

At the most basic level, you can
evaluate two variables using a
comparison operator to return a
t rue or f al se value.
In this example, a user is taking a
test, and the script te lls the user
whether they have passed this
round of the test.
The example starts by setting
two variables:
1. pass to hold the pass mark
2. score to hold the users score
To see if the user has passed,
a comparison operator checks
whether score is greater than or
equal to pass. The result will be
true or false, and is stored in
a variable called has Passed. On
the next line, the result is written
to the screen.
The last two lines select the
element whose id attribute
has a value of answer, and then
updates its contents. You will
learn more about this technique
in the next chapter.

## COMPARING TWO EXPRESSIONS

1. In this example, there are two
rounds to the test and the
code will check if the user has
achieved a new high score,
beating the previous record.

2. The script starts by storing the
user's scores for each round
in variables. Then the highest
scores for each round are stored
in two more va riables.

3. The comparison operator checks
if the user's total score is greater
than the highest score for the
test and stores the result in a
variable called comparison.

4. In the comparison operator, the
operand on the left calculates
the user's total score. The
operand on the right adds
together the highest scores for
each round. The result is then
added to the page.

5. When you assign the result of
the comparison to a variable,
you do not strictly need the
containing parentheses (shown
in white on the left-hand page).

6. Some programmers use them
anyway to indicate that the code
evaluates into a single value.
Others only use containing
parentheses when they form
part of a condition.


# loop counters 


a for loop uses a counter as a condition this instructs the code to run a specified number of times.
here you can see the condition is made up of three statements:

1. **initialization** create a variable and set it to 0, this variable commonly called i, and it acts as the counter.

2. **condition** the loop should contine to run until the counter reaches a specified number.

3. **Update** every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter.
