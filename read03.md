## what is Git?
Snapshots

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

## Tracking Changes

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

## Loss of Data

Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.

## States

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

Committed

Data is securely stored in a local database

Modified

File has been changed but not committed to the database

## Importing
To import an existing project or directory into Git, follow these steps using the Terminal or Command Line:

Switch to the target project’s directory
Example:

$ cd test (cd = change directory)
Use the git init command
$ git init
Note: At this stage, you have created a new subdirectory named .git that has the repository files. Tracking has not commenced.

To start tracking these repository files, perform an initial commit by typing the following:
$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m “any message here”
Now, your files are tracked and there’s an initial commit. We will discuss the particular commands in detail soon.

## Cloning
You can also create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone command with a repository’s URL:

$ git clone https://github.com/test
By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.

To clone a repository into a directory with another name of your choosing, use the following command format:

$ git clone https://github.com/test mydirectory
The command above makes a copy of the target repository in a directory named “mydirectory.”


## Check File Status
To determine the state of files, utilize the git status command:

$ git status
On branch master

nothing to commit, working directory clean

*This information indicates which branch you’re on (we will cover branches in a later section) and states “working directory clean,” which means that files have tracked or modified status at the moment. Also, no untracked files are present because Git has not listed any.


## Tracking and Staging a New File
Single File

Track one file only by using the following format:

git add filename
All Files

Track all files in a repository by using the following command:

$ git add *
*After using these commands, files are tracked and staged for committing.

After adding a new file called EXAMPLE, you would see information regarding changes to be committed when using the git status command:

$ git status

On branch master

Changes to be committed:

  (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage)
new file: EXAMPLE
This information tells us that there are changes to be committed and that the file has been staged.

## Committing a File
After staging one or multiple files, you should commit the changes and record what you did within the commit message:

$ git commit -m “made change x,y,z”
*This step has committed changes for the file or files (you can have one commit message for multiple files, if applicable) to the HEAD.

## Committing All Changes
$ git commit -a
*This command commits a snapshot of all modifications to tracked files in the working directory.

## Pushing Changes
Next, you would push changes to a remote repository. We will discuss remote repositories in more depth in the next section. For now, we will look at a general overview of pushing changes to remotes.

Example:

$ git push origin master
*This command pushes changes from the local “master” branch to the remote repository named “origin”.

*For cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local repository. However, these names can be changed by the user.
